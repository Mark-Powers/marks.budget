        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the alpha budget app! You've been given exclusive access to this secret trial</p>
        <p>Here is how I use this site</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Expenses go in <em>Ledger</em>. Income also goes in the ledger as negative</li>
            <li>I log expenses as soon as possible. If no date is entered, it defaults to now.</li>
            <li>The category I use for big categories: bills, groceries, restaurants</li>
            <li>Inside tags (which aren't csv yet) I have specifics: internet, coffee, gas</li>
            <li><em>Summary</em> gives some view of where money is going and coming from</li>
            <li><em>Expected</em> is what I expect in an out, for a period of days. For example, I pay internet every 31 days, and renew my domain every 365 days</li>
            <li><em>Goals</em> can be used to subdivide net savings into categories. It is still W.I.P.</li>
        </ol>
